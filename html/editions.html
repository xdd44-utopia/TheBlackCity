            <i><b>BLACK city</b></i> examines American cities and renders visible the implicit and explicit policies, customs, and beliefs that have affected social structures and power dynamics and shaped the physical spaces of Black settlements. Complex racial histories reveal how the patterns and structures of the past link to and engender the present. The work distills these histories through various media, including buildings, maps, timelines, glossaries, and games, to provide an alternative reading of Black settlements and community-building methods in narratives of resistance, resilience, and transcendence. Collectively, these projects compensate for official records of Black spaces that are often absent, a symptom of slavery and subordination. The projects manifest the traces and lacunae of official records as material and spatial presences and objects of design. They generate a foundation for speculation on future possibilities for Black settlements (and Black life).

            This body of research began in the essay <b>black bodies black space: A-Waiting Spectacle</b> which appeared in the anthology <i>White Papers, Black Marks: Architecture, Race, Culture</i> (Athlone Press, 2000). The Black City Editions were originally installed as individual projects in themed group exhibitions.

            <i><b>BLACK City Editions</b></i> explore both general and specific conditions of Blackness in America by representing socio-spatial phenomena that reflect customs, laws and events at the national and local scales: gentrification in the New York Edition (black city2), 2003-4; restrictive covenants in the Los Angeles Edition, 2020; racial expulsions and sundown towns in the Arkansas Edition, 2022; and in Jim Crow era legal topographies of segregation and integration in de Facto/de Jure | By Custom/By Law, 2006.

            The Venice Edition: The BLACK city Astrolabe is a network comprised of points and lines extracted from events and movements in settlements and cities outlining the African diaspora. Within it, is a constellation unearthing the lives of “Black” women since the 15th century. From the multiple displacements of race and gender, the Black City Astrolabe, a space-time field comprised of a 3-D map and 24-hour cycle of narratives reorders the forces of subjugation, devaluation, and displacement through the spaces, events, and narratives of African diasporic women. The project received the support of the MIT Department of Architecture and a CAST Mellon Faculty grant from the MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology (CAST). On exhibit 20 May - 26 November 2023.

            The Arkansas Edition: Histories of Negation was commissioned for Architecture at Home, a group show of affordable house prototypes curated by Dylan Turk at Crystal Bridges Museum for American Art (2022). The project comprises a house prototype, Totem House, that is inscribed with Histories of Negation, a timeline of settlements and expulsions in Northwest Arkansas that illustrates the negation of Indigenous Nations and African American settlements from 1750 to the present. The events etched on the surfaces of the Totem House can be explored on the website Histories of Negationwhich expands the inscriptions in an interactive timeline that draws connections between events, people, and places. The project received the support of the MIT Department of Architecture. Production of the website was made possible through the support of a Fay Chandler grant from the MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology (CAST). On exhibit through March 2024.

            The Los Angeles Edition examines Black settlement from the founding of the Puebla de Los Angeles in 1531 through the American statehood of Los Angeles in 1850 to the present day. The project comprises maps that trace the migration of historic Black settlements within contemporary Los Angeles; a model detail that represents the expanding and contracting forces of integration and segregation; and dictionary plates that feature buildings and spaces central to the narrative of Black settlement in Los Angeles.
